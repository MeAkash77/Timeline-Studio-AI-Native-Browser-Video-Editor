# Timeline Studio

## Responsible use of deep synthesis

This tool uses deep-synthesis technology and is intended solely for technical research and learning.

Users must ensure that they:

- use only facial images or videos of themselves or people who have provided lawful authorization;
- do not create or distribute any illegal, infringing, false, or misleading content;
- do not present generated content as authentic footage or impersonate another person without their consent.

Users are solely responsible for any legal liability arising from violations of these requirements.

## Project updates

- **2026-09-27** — Automatic captions now use word timestamps with short-phrase or word-by-word grouping, preventing long subtitle blocks in portrait videos. Preview, export and SRT share the same editable timed clips; controls support all 13 interface languages. AI voice generation also splits long scripts before synthesis and times each caption to its own audio, including caption-scoped voice generation. Caption display and SRT hide trailing commas, periods and semicolons while retaining expressive punctuation and the original editing/voice text.
- **2026-09-27** — Desktop playback now pages the timeline at the 85% edge, returning the playhead to 20%. Manual horizontal scrolling suspends following; Return to playhead or restarting playback restores it. Pausing preserves the view.
- **2026-09-27** — Unified video clips: main-video and picture-in-picture clips now combine a filename rail, filmstrip and source-audio waveform. Adjust each clip’s dB directly on its waveform, with matching preview/export gain and gain retained after audio separation. Includes all 13 interface languages. All audio lanes use fine bottom-aligned waveforms that follow gain, with orange caps above the display ceiling and existing track styling preserved. Timeline scrubbing advances the preview without waiting for compositor callbacks; release retains exact-frame confirmation.
- **2026-09-21 — Remove pauses:** Smart now detects long speech pauses locally with Silero VAD, lets you review and select cuts, and trims the selected main-track video with its source audio. Adjustable pause thresholds, retained gaps, ripple editing, cancellation and undo are included, with direct UI copy in all 13 languages.
- **2026-09-20 — Playhead marker snapping:** Dragging the white playhead previews the picture live and snaps to markers and range edges, with a shared alignment guide and time readout. Hold Alt to scrub freely. Marker details show Done until edited, then Apply changes.
