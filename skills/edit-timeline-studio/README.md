## Responsible use of deep synthesis

This tool uses deep-synthesis technology and is intended solely for technical research and learning.

Users must ensure that they:

- use only facial images or videos of themselves or people who have provided lawful authorization;
- do not create or distribute any illegal, infringing, false, or misleading content;
- do not present generated content as authentic footage or impersonate another person without their consent.

Users are solely responsible for any legal liability arising from violations of these requirements.

## Project updates

- **2026-09-27** — Automatic captions now use word timestamps with short-phrase or word-by-word grouping, preventing long subtitle blocks in portrait videos. Preview, export and SRT share the same editable timed clips; controls support all 13 interface languages. AI voice generation also splits long scripts before synthesis and times each caption to its own audio, including caption-scoped voice generation. Caption display and SRT hide trailing commas, periods and semicolons while retaining expressive punctuation and the original editing/voice text.
- **2026-09-27** — Desktop playback now pages the timeline at the 85% edge, returning the playhead to 20%. Manual horizontal scrolling suspends following; Return to playhead or restarting playback restores it. Pausing preserves the view.
- **2026-09-27** — Unified video clips: main-video and picture-in-picture clips now combine a filename rail, filmstrip and source-audio waveform. Adjust each clip’s dB directly on its waveform, with matching preview/export gain and gain retained after audio separation. Includes all 13 interface languages. All audio lanes use fine bottom-aligned waveforms that follow gain, with orange caps above the display ceiling and existing track styling preserved. Timeline scrubbing advances the preview without waiting for compositor callbacks; release retains exact-frame confirmation.
- **2026-09-21 — Remove pauses:** Smart now detects long speech pauses locally with Silero VAD, lets you review and select cuts, and trims the selected main-track video with its source audio. Adjustable pause thresholds, retained gaps, ripple editing, cancellation and undo are included, with direct UI copy in all 13 languages.
- **2026-09-20 — Playhead marker snapping:** Dragging the white playhead previews the picture live and snaps to markers and range edges, with a shared alignment guide and time readout. Hold Alt to scrub freely. Marker details show Done until edited, then Apply changes.

Timeline Studio is a local-first browser video editor plus an Agent Skill for creating editable, multi-track `.timeline` projects. It combines visual assembly, timed captions, multilingual AI voiceover, overlays, audio tools, and deterministic browser rendering without turning the project into an opaque one-off script.

Use it when a user asks an Agent to make a vertical short from images, synchronize captions with narration, prepare localized versions, modify an existing editable project, or verify a browser video-editing workflow.

## What can it produce?

## What it can automate

- Inspect, dry-run, and transactionally modify a portable `.timeline` archive through a versioned JSON command plan.
- Work with an open browser project through 15 native WebMCP tools when available: inspect the timeline, assets and markers; review and apply visual/caption/audio/marker operations and existing-asset or picture-in-picture insertion; seek, undo and save an editable copy; or prepare and run real video export with progress, output receipts and cancellation. See [browser integration](references/webmcp-integration.md).
- Move voiceover clips; update caption text and timing; unlink or relink caption/audio pairs.
- Import local visual or audio assets through the command runner with probing, SHA-256 integrity metadata, and portable archive embedding; use archived media for Visuals assembly and overlays.
- Use the browser compatibility path for AI speech, automatic captions, effects, unsupported editor operations, and final video export while more commands move into the shared registry.
- Preserve the editable project as the source of truth and verify the reopened result.

The command runner reads and writes `.timeline` projects, supports deterministic local media import, and can render its documented portable Visuals + Voiceover + Music subset to verified MP4. AI generation and richer composition rendering remain available through the local or hosted browser editor.

## Install

```bash
npx skills add MartinDelophy/ai-video-editor --skill edit-timeline-studio
```

Skill installation copies the workflow but deliberately does not modify the host. On first local use, run the read-only dependency doctor:

```bash
node scripts/setup-host.mjs --check
```

If Node.js is missing, start with `sh scripts/bootstrap-host.sh --check` on macOS/Linux or `scripts/bootstrap-host.ps1` in Windows PowerShell. Both show an explicit language-runtime plan before their opt-in install mode.

If tools are missing, review the printed plan and explicitly authorize the interactive installer with `node scripts/setup-host.mjs --install`. It installs only declared media tools and pinned Python analysis packages in an isolated Timeline Studio runtime. It never bundles model downloads, GPU drivers, credentials, or paid services. See [host environment setup](references/host-environment.md).

Agent-driven Chinese and mixed Chinese/English narration uses Timeline Studio's owned Hojo TTS Light 80M FP16 browser bundle with two stable voices: 晴岚 and 若溪. Autoregressive generation runs on WebGPU and stable waveform decoding runs on WASM. It does not require MeloTTS, UniDic, or a separate Python voiceover environment. The first explicit generation downloads independently verified 16 MiB shards through ModelScope-first/Hugging-Face-fallback delivery and the editor caches them for repeat use. Product/software tutorials, vlog/travel/event recaps, product marketing/commerce shorts, and narrative/documentary condensations are narrated by default; existing authorized source speech is reused, and missing narration is synthesized locally before picture timing.

Claude Code and Codex can also install through GitHub CLI:

```bash
gh skill install MartinDelophy/ai-video-editor edit-timeline-studio --agent claude-code --scope user
gh skill install MartinDelophy/ai-video-editor edit-timeline-studio --agent codex --scope user
```

For repository development:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MartinDelophy/ai-video-editor.git
cd ai-video-editor
npm install
npm run agent -- project.inspect /absolute/path/project.timeline
npm run dev
```
